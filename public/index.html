            <div class="md:w-1/2">
                <p>Crocs, Inc., is a Colorado maker of unique clogs that became extremely popular in the early 2000s with both men and women. Originally intended for use on boats and in other outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, and gardening, Crocs has also found a market with working people who spend a lot of time in their feet, such as health care and restaurant workers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In some circles, essentially younger girls, these straps are traded among wearers to provide a different look. Because of their broad appeal, Crocs are available through numerous distribution channels: traditional footwear retailers, sporting goods and outdoor retailers, department stores, uniform suppliers, specialty food retailers, gift shops, health and beauty stores, and catalogs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="md:w-1/2">
                <p>Crocs was founded by Lyndon "Duke" Hanson, and George Boedecker Jr. to produce and distribute a foam clog, the design of which was acquired from a company called Foam Creations. The shoe was originally developed as a boating shoe. The first model produced by Crocs, the Beach, was unveiled in 2001 at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in Florida, and sold out the 200 pairs produced at that time. It has since sold 300 million pairs of shoes.</p>
                <p>That is more than 900,000 crocs saved in waste. Furthermore, it only takes 1.6kwh of energy to make one pair of croc shoes. So, the phenomenal Crocs seem unstoppable as just before their tenth anniversary they had sold more than 200 million pairs in more than 90 countries, reaching sales revenues of $1 billion. Consequently, it seems the love and hate relationship of Crocs is here to stay as they continue expanding and developing their range of clogs, sandals, shoes and boots.</p>

                <p>The Crocs™ brand stands for innovation, fun and comfort for people who want shoes that conform to their personalities and lifestyles, as well as to their feet. Now in more styles and in more places for more occasions than ever before, Crocs™ is taking a big step forward in providing intuitive comfort to feet everywhere.</p>
                <p>In its founding year, 2002, Crocs™ introduced an innovative shoe made of a revolutionary material called Croslite™. Croslite™ technology held unique characteristics that allowed it to perform on both land and in water, characteristics new to the footwear industry. The company was given the name Crocs™ after the multi-environment, amphibious nature of Crocodiles.</p>

                    <p>"Crocs offer more protection for your feet than flip-flops," says Glickman. "Flip-flops don't provide a lot of arch support; they're open-toed so you can stub your toe and hurt yourself. Crocs offer more protection and comfort than that." Baravarian says Crocs have more positive attributes than negative, but they're no substitute for the real deal.Considered a therapeutic shoe, Crocs provide long-term relief from foot pain and is an ideal footwear alternative for people who have had foot surgery or people who have certain health conditions. Dr. Toole uses Crocs in her daily practice and advises her patients who have had foot surgery to wear them following surgery.</p>
